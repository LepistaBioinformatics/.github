# The Story Behind the Name

## About this document

This document tells the story behind the choice of the name *Lepista* for this laboratory — where the name comes from, what it represents, and why a genus of mushrooms became the symbol of an open source bioinformatics lab.

## A Network Below the Surface

What you see above ground — those broad violet caps, dense with closely-packed gills the color of faded lilac — is only the fruiting body. The announcement. Beneath the surface lies the true organism: kilometers of mycelium threading through the soil, exchanging nutrients, processing organic matter, building invisible connections between roots, leaves, and everything decomposing in between.

The fruiting body is ephemeral. The network is permanent.

Bioinformatics works the same way. The tools we publish — command-line utilities, API gateways, analysis pipelines — are the fruiting bodies. Visible, tangible, shareable. But beneath them lies the real work: months of reading, thinking, failing, rebuilding. The invisible mycelium of understanding that makes the visible tool possible. You rarely see it. It is always there.

## The Ring Has No Center

*Lepista nuda* grows in fairy rings — perfect circles that expand outward by roughly 60 centimeters each year. The mycelium radiates from its point of origin, but the center dies as nutrients are exhausted. Only the edge is alive.

A fairy ring has no headquarters. No queen mushroom. Every individual on the perimeter is equal. Every node in the network contributes to the whole. The ring expands because of its periphery, not in spite of it. Medieval Europeans called these circles portals to another world — and in a way, they were right. They are portals to the invisible world of the network beneath.

That is the community we want to build: a ring with no center that keeps expanding, powered by contributors at its edge. Every new voice is a new node. Every pull request is the ring growing by one more step.

## A Chalice for Knowledge

The genus name *Lepista* comes from the Latin: a wide, shallow wine vessel — a chalice used to hold and serve something precious at the table. The mature cap of *Lepista nuda* takes exactly this form: broad, slightly concave, shaped by time into something that holds.

Our lab is that chalice. We hold knowledge in the form of open tools and publish them freely, inviting others to drink from the same source and add their own contributions to the vessel. The name *nuda* — Latin for *bare*, *naked* — speaks to the species' smooth, unadorned surface. No rings, no scales, no pretense. Open source in the most literal sense.

## The Persistence of Violet

There is one more reason *Lepista nuda* was chosen above all others.

It is one of the last fungi to fruit in the season. It does not emerge in the lush warmth of summer, when conditions are easy and competition is fierce. It waits for the first frost. It appears when everything else has given up and the ground is hard and uninviting.

This is the spirit we carry: a willingness to push forward on hard problems, to build tools for questions that do not yet have easy answers, and to persist in the work even when the season seems wrong. The violet of *Lepista* is not the color of comfort. It is the color of what remains when everything softer has retreated.

## Why Lepista?

Because it appears when others give up.

Because it builds invisible networks that become visible at the right moment.

Because its color — that particular violet, between the cold blue of raw data and the warm red of living biology — is exactly the space where bioinformatics lives.

Because *Lepista* means chalice, and we believe knowledge should be shared like wine at a table: freely, generously, and in good company.

And because every great project deserves a reminder that the most important work is the network no one can see.

## Join the Ring

The mycelium is expanding.

If you are a biologist who codes, a software engineer curious about life sciences, a data scientist searching for meaningful problems, or simply someone who believes that open science makes the world better — there is space on the ring for you.

Every contribution matters. Every node strengthens the network. Every new voice helps the ring grow.
