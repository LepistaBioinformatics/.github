## About

Lepista Bioinformatics Lab is a virtual open-source laboratory publishing free tools for **bioinformatics** and **general software development**. Our projects range from sequence analysis pipelines and phylogenetic placers to modern API gateways and knowledge graph builders — all designed with quality architecture in mind.

We believe that good software and good science are inseparable. That's why every project here follows solid engineering principles: clean architecture, performance-first design, and clear documentation.
